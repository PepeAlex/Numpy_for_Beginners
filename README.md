  This project is research about NumPy-random, your subsets and your functions as part of the Programming for Data Analysis at Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology has Brian Mcginley as lector.
  I briefly describe Numpy, how to install and what you need to use it. After that I also describe Numpy.random and its function. The propouse of this project is also delivery it in the Jupyter Notebook, so you will find the file named Prog_data.ipynb to see every topics in detail.
